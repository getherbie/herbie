# Quickstart

Here is the short version of how to install a simple Herbie website using a website template.

    composer create-project getherbie/start-website mywebsite
    cd mywebsite/web
    php -S localhost:8888 index.php

That's it!

After that, the website <http://localhost:8888> can be opened in the browser.

For the above commands, however, basic knowledge of using the console and Composer, the dependency manager for PHP, is required.
But it's really not witchcraft and shouldn't be too difficult.

It gets more exciting when you customize the layout, add new pages, or edit content.

If problems have already occurred at this point, the first thing you should do is check all system requirements.
