# Documentation

This documentation explains the most important topics for creating a website or blog with Herbie.

## What exactly is Herbie?

Herbie is a content management system based on flat-files and therefore does not require a database.
The content of the website is loaded from the file system from simple text files.
The program goes through a defined directory of text files, converts these files according to their file extension and outputs them - embedded in an HTML layout - as a complete website.

Herbie is influenced by flat-file CMS systems from the Ruby, Go and PHP world. 
Among them are names like [Grav][4], [Hugo][3], [Jekyll][1], [Stacey][5] or [Statamic][2], just to name a few.
The project was born out of the need to have a system available to realize websites easily and quickly.
The development is based on a current version of PHP and the use of proven concepts and components.

## Where is the name coming from?

Well, the name comes from Herbie Hancock.
He is one of the most impressive and influential jazz musicians of all time.
So in a way this project is dedicated to him and his work.
