# Quickstart

Here is the short version of how to install a simple Herbie CMS website using a website template.

    composer create-project getherbie/start-website mywebsite
    cd mywebsite/web
    php -S localhost:8888 index.php

That's all!

After that, the website <http://localhost:8888> can be opened in the browser.

For the above commands, however, basic knowledge of using the console and Composer, the package management for PHP, is required.
But it's really not witchcraft and shouldn't be too difficult.

It gets more exciting when you customize the layout and add new pages, blogposts and content.

If problems have already arisen at this point, the first thing to do is to check all system requirements.
