Herbie
======

Herbie is a file based CMS &amp; blog system.

**Herbie is not ready for production use yet.**

This fork uses a different markdown-parser based on [cebe/markdown](https://github.com/Netzweberei/markdown) to define a simple twitter-bootstrap grid like in https://github.com/dreikanter/markdown-grid
